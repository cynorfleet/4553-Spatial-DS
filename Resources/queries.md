## Possible Queries

5. Find Interesting Features along a path:
    - Select a starting point: `X` and a destination point `Y`
    - Determine a milti-line path between `X` & `Y`
    - Highlight all features with `R` radius of the entire path

3. Nearest Neighbor: Click on the world map and get the nearest `______________` within `XXX` miles, possibly with specific features further filtering the query (magnitude of earthquake, etc.)
        1. Cities
        2. Volcanos
        3. Earthquakes
        4. Airports 

Use clustering to find the top 5 clusters of volcanoes and/or earthquakes. Query to find which city is most central to each cluster. 
Route through airports from origin destination to each destination and then back home again for a World Disaster Tour. Use Indiana Jones Travel music


1. Evacuation From Continent: 
	- Shortest path from each country in a given continent to predetermined destination (Sahara desert)
	- Along some predetermined escape route.
 
2. Plan a political campaign:
    -  Politician covers the most area (in a single country) in the shortest amount of flights. 
    


4. Identify the countries (or areas via clustering) with the most:
        1. Cities
        2. Volcanos
        3. Earthquakes
        4. Airports 



6. Calculate Danger Level:
		-  Highlight a country (or region)
		- Change color coding based on some formula
		- Formula would include magnitudes of earthquakes, proximity of volcanos, distance from airports, etc..
		- We need hurricane and tsunami data!!

7.  Plan a "world tour" to visit `_____________`, 
	- Take into account the nearest airports for travel
	- And the nearest cities for lodging.
    - Shortest path would be great
    - Longest path would be greater!

8. Find disasters which occurred within `X` hrs,  and find the distance between places.

============

9. Find features with the largest `X` (highest volcanos, biggest earth quakes, etc.) and map routes between them.

10. Map showing earth quake safe zones  on the planet.

11. What states are larger than whole countries

Find shortest route for all continent/country/city/airport 
	travel vacation
	
	query data by selecting a valcanoe on a map then we figure out what states and countries we go to see it, the catch is however if it is by a earthquake spot we have a chance that we need to be rereouted to a safe city where no earthquakes are happening
	
	
	1. Use clustering to find the top 5 clusters of volcanoes and/or earthquakes. Query to find which city is most central to each cluster. Route through airports from origin destination to each destination and then back home again for a World Disaster Tour. Use Indiana Jones Travel music

2. Find the volcanoes with the most number of earthquakes within X distance. Color code these areas red for high hazard. Find the volcanoes with the least number of earthquakes within X distance. Color code these areas blue for low hazard. Could add different color codes for zones inbetween the extremes.

3. User can click on world map to cause a natural disaster. The closest volcano erupts or earthquake (based on past earthquakes) occurs. The area around the disaster (X miles) becomes a different color (bounding box?). Lines drawn from cities within the disaster area indicate people fleeing to the closest airports not in the disaster area.
